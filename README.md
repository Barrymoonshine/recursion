# Recursion project

## Summary

The Recursion Project consists of two problems to solve using recursion:

- The Fibonacci Sequence
- The MergeSort algorithm

Note: no front end has been created as part of this project, see script.js for solutions to both problems.

This project was completed as part of the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full stack javascript curriculum.

## Key learning points

- Using functions that call recursively call themselves to solve a programming problem
- Setting a base case so that the recursive loop is exited and the call stack maximum size is not exceeded
- Divide and conquer algorithms
- Using the spread operator to concatenate a new array
